# Common Rules

## Monorepo Structure

- use turbo for building and running the project
- Apps go in `apps/*` (e.g., `apps/api`, `apps/web`)
- Shared packages go in `packages/*` (e.g., `packages/db`, `packages/services`)
- Use package exports in `package.json` instead of `index.ts` files
- Import from workspace packages using `@basement/*` namespace

## Linting

After making changes to the code, run `biome lint --write` to lint the code. If any warnings or errors are found, fix them.

## Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line width: 100 characters
- Use Biome for formatting and linting (configured in `biome.json`)
- Use async/await over promises when possible

## TypeScript

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer type inference where possible
- Export types alongside their schemas/definitions
- Use `workspace:*` for internal package dependencies
